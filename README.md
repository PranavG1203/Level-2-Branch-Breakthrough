# Level-2-Branch-Breakthrough

## Objective
I am a path that splits in two,  
One leads to changes, the other to you.  
In this quest, you will create and modify,  
Merging back together, so give it a try.  
With each branch, a story unfolds,  
Resolve the conflict, let the truth be told.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Create `Level2.txt` in the Main Branch**:
   - Create a new file named `Level2.txt` in the main branch and write "Main branch" in it.

3. **Create and Switch to the Feature Branch**:
   - Create a new feature branch.

4. **Modify `Level2.txt`**:
   - Change the contents of `Level2.txt` to "Feature branch."

5. **Switch Back to the Main Branch**:
   - Go back to the main branch.

6. **Merge the Feature Branch**:
   - Attempt to merge the feature branch into the main branch. This will create a merge conflict.

7. **Resolve the Merge Conflict**:
   - Open `Level2.txt` and modify it to include both statements:
     - "Main branch"
     - "Feature branch"

8. **Complete the Merge**:
   - Finalize the merge process.

9. **Push the Changes to the Main Branch**:
   - Push the merged changes back to the remote repository.

## Submission
Once you have completed the steps above, ensure that all changes are pushed to the main branch. Your assignment will be automatically graded based on the contents of `Level2.txt` and the merge process.
